## Files and Structure

- `sentiment_analysis.py`: The main Python script for sentiment analysis.
- `Twitter_Data.csv`: The dataset used for sentiment analysis.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages for running the script.
- `README.md`: Detailed information about the repository, setup, and usage.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher).
3. Install the required packages using the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the sentiment analysis script :

python sentiment_analysis.py



## Dataset

The dataset `Twitter_Data.csv` contains text data and sentiment labels for sentiment analysis. The script preprocesses this data, trains a classifier, and evaluates its accuracy.

## Usage

- Modify the `Twitter_Data.csv` file or provide your own dataset for sentiment analysis.
- Customize the preprocessing steps or classifier options in the `sentiment_analysis.py` script as needed.
- Execute the script using the setup instructions provided above.

## Notes

- This project is intended for educational purposes and provides a basic example of sentiment analysis using the Naive Bayes classifier.
- Feel free to explore and experiment with different preprocessing techniques, classifiers, and datasets.
